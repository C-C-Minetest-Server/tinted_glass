# Tinted Glass

This mod adds tinted glass obtainable from dyes and glass blocks. Optionally, this mod registers tinted glass [platform screen doors](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Emojiminetest/advtrains_doors/) if the mod is available.

This mod is an extract from [LinuxForks's Moreblocks Undo](https://git.bananach.space/moreblocks.git) mod. If you have just migrated from that mod to this, consider enabling `tinted_glass.lifo_compact` in `minetest.conf`.
